# Sorting Algorithm Analysis with C++ and Python
- ## Complexity Analysis of Sorting Algorithms:
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Counting Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Radix Sort
- ## Work Flow:
- Each algorithm is implemented in a header file.
- The driver program includes the headers and makes calls to the respective sorting function when indicated by the user
- The algorithm is timed using the chrono library from the C++ STL
- The timed results are outputted into a text file named as follows **sortingName_times.txt**
- Python's matplotlib then plots the results
